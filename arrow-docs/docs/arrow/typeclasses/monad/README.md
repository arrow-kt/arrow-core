## Monad




`Monad` is a typeclass that abstracts over sequential execution of code.
This doc focuses on the methods provided by the typeclass.
If you'd like a long explanation of its origins with simple examples with nullable, `Option`, and `List`,
head to [The Monad Tutorial]({{ '/patterns/monads' | relative_url }}).

### Main Combinators

`Monad` includes all combinators present in [`Applicative`]({{ '/arrow/typeclasses/applicative/' | relative_url }}) and [`Selective`]({{ '/arrow/typeclasses/selective/' | relative_url }}).

#### Kind<F, A>#flatMap

Takes a continuation function from the value `A` to a new `Kind<F, B>`, and returns a `Kind<F, B>`.
Internally, `flatMap` unwraps the value inside the `Kind<F, A>` and applies the function to obtain the new `Kind<F, B>`.

Because `Kind<F, B>` cannot be created until `A` is unwrapped, it means that one cannot exists until the other has been executed, effectively making them a sequential chain of execution.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.core.*
import arrow.core.extensions.*
import arrow.fx.*

Some(1).flatMap { a ->
  Some(a + 1)
}
```

The improvement of `flatMap` over regular function composition is that `flatMap` understands sealed datatypes, and allows for short-circuiting execution.

```kotlin:ank
None.flatMap { a: Int ->
  Some(a + 1)
}
```

```kotlin:ank
Right(1).flatMap { _ ->
  Left("Error")
}.flatMap { b: Int ->
  Right(b + 1)
}
```

Note that, depending on the implementation of `Kind<F, A>`, this chaining function may be executed immediately, i.e., for `Option` or `Either`;
or lazily, i.e., `suspend` or `Flow`.

#### Kind<F, Kind<F, A>>#flatten

Combines two nested elements into one `Kind<F, A>`.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.core.extensions.option.monad.flatten

Some(Some(1)).flatten()
```

```kotlin:ank
Some(None).flatten()
```

#### mproduct

Like `flatMap`, but it combines the two sequential elements in a `Tuple2`.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.core.extensions.option.monad.mproduct

Some(5).mproduct {
  Some(it * 11)
}
```

#### followedBy/followedByEval

Sequentially executes two elements that are independent from one another.
The [`Eval`]({{ '/apidocs/arrow-core-data/arrow.core/-eval' | relative_url }}) variant allows you to pass lazily calculated values.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.core.extensions.option.monad.followedBy

Some(1).followedBy(Some(2))
```

#### flatTap (formerly ~~effectM~~)

Sequentially executes two elements and ignores the result of the second. This is useful for effects like logging.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.core.extensions.option.monad.flatTap

fun logValue(i: Int): Option<Unit> = Some(println(i))

Some(1).flatTap(::logValue)
```

#### productL/productLEval (formerly ~~forEffect~~/~~forEffectEval~~)

Sequentially executes two elements that are independent from one another, ignoring the value of the second one.
The [`Eval`]({{ '/apidocs/arrow-core-data/arrow.core/-eval' | relative_url }}) variant allows you to pass lazily calculated values.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.core.extensions.option.monad.*

Some(1).productL(Some(2))
```

### Laws

Arrow provides [`MonadLaws`][monad_law_source]{:target="_blank"} in the form of test cases for internal verification of lawful instances and third party apps creating their own Monad instances.

#### Creating your own `Monad` instances

Arrow already provides `Monad` instances for most common datatypes both in Arrow and the Kotlin stdlib.

See [Deriving and creating custom typeclass]({{ '/patterns/glossary' | relative_url }}) to provide your own `Monad` instances for custom datatypes.

### Data types

The following data types in Arrow provide instances that adhere to the `Monad` type class.

```kotlin:ank:replace
import arrow.reflect.*
import arrow.typeclasses.Monad

TypeClass(Monad::class).dtMarkdownList()
```

<canvas id="hierarchy-diagram" style="margin-top:120px"></canvas>

<script>
  drawNomNomlDiagram('hierarchy-diagram', 'monad.nomnol')
</script>

```kotlin:ank:outFile(monad.nomnol)
import arrow.reflect.*
import arrow.typeclasses.Monad

TypeClass(Monad::class).hierarchyGraph()
```
