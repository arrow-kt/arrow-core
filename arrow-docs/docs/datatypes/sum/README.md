## Sum

> The sum of two Comonads is also a Comonad.

A Sum is a data structure that holds two [`Comonads`]({{ '/arrow/typeclasses/comonad' | relative_url }}) and a flag for selecting which one is "active".

A common pattern used when building user interfaces is showing two tabs and allowing the user to change between them. We can achieve this behavior with Sum.

For creating a Sum, we need two comonadic datatypes in which the `extract` result type is the same. We will also need an initial sideâ€”by default it is Left.

```kotlin:ank
import arrow.ui.*
import arrow.ui.extensions.store.comonad.*

val counterStore = Store(0) { "Counter value: $it" }
val nameStore = Store("Cotel") { "Hey $it!" }

val sum = Sum(counterStore, nameStore)
sum.extract(Store.comonad(), Store.comonad())
```

We can change the active side with `changeSide`.

```kotlin:ank
sum.changeSide(Sum.Side.Right).extract(Store.comonad(), Store.comonad())
```

As Sum is also a `Comonad`, we have access to `coflatmap` and `map` for changing the `extract` result.

```kotlin:ank
val overriddenSum = sum.coflatmap(Store.comonad(), Store.comonad()) {
  when (it.side) {
    is Sum.Side.Left -> "Current side is Left"
    is Sum.Side.Right -> "Current side is Right"
  }
}

overriddenSum.extract(Store.comonad(), Store.comonad())
```
